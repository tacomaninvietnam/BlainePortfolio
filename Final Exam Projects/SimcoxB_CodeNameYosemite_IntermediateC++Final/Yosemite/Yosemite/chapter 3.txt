The Orc falls from the blow of your weapon.
His broken form lays dead on ground, blood 
pooling from his wounds.

You fall to your knees as a sharp pain rises 
from your previous injury.  Upon examination 
of the wound, you realize you were attacked 
by a bear, the force of the blow keeping 
you unconcious while you slept.

You must get to a healer to repair your wounds.
There is a city just a few miles from your camp 
where doctors are in no short supply.  You grab 
your food and gear and head up the road toward 
the city of Josser Conoria.
