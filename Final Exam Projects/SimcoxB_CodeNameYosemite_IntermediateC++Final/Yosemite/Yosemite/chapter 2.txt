You manage to close the wound and stop the
bleeding.  
You notice a crackle of twigs from the woods
behind you.
Your vision still blurry you can make out 
the silhouette of a humanoid approaching
from the woods.
It is as you feared an Orc has raided 
your camp, and even worse, he sees that
you are still alive.
You scramble to your feet, grabbing your 
weapon only to be confronted by the towering
hulk that stands before you.
He glares at you, porcine nostrils flaring as
it mounts a charge.
