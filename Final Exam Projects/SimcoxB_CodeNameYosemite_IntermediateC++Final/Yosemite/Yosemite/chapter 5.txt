You manage to get to the gates by 
night-fall.  You are greeted at the 
gates by a robust guard.  Going by his
body language, you can tell your 
presence is an annoyance.

"Halt, no vistiors to the city!"

before you have time to turn around,
you hear the guard screaming, "And 
weapons are illegal for your types, 
you're coming with me!"

He draws his weapon and holds it to 
your throat.  You knock it away inciting 
a fight.
