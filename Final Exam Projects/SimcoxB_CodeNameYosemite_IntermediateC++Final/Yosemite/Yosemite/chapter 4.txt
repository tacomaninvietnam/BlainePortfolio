A few hours go by as you walk slowly, 
bowing over from your wounds.
You come to a fallen tree, who's trunk
had been cut in several places and arranged 
in roughshod benches to accomodate travelers.

You can see the walls of the city from here, 
rising ever massive, like standinggods in 
the far off distance.

You can tell this area is heavily used by 
visitors to the nearby city.  Maybe there
is something useful left behind.
