Your vision clears, blurred from the blow 
of an anonymous attacker.  As you come to,
you open your eyes and fear that you have 
been brutalized by a local tribe of orcs 
while you were sleeping. 
 
Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your
belly, that reveals deep claw marks gashed 
in by some large predator. The fact that 
you are still alive puzzles you.  What 
could have scared off your assailant? You
cough, and blood fills your mouth, you
realize your wounds are severe.  You are 
bleeding to death, and without proper 
care you will die.  Your first order of 
business is cauterizing the wound.  There
are still some smoldering sticks in your 
campfire from the night before.
What are you going to do?
